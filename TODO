BUGS
====
- There is some outer space in gridfit and horizgrid layouts, fix.
- Last column in grid{fill,fit} are oversized when there are too many clients if gaps are enabled, fix.
- The last column in both rows in horizgrid and bottomstack layout may leave some space, fix.

FEATURES
========
- Move gaps into Pertag.
- Make gaps toggleable per tag.
- Make initgappx per tag.
- Reverse smfact and cfact.
- Implement a layout like tile that uniformly distributes the clients in the two columns.
- Add shift+super+tab binding to move all clients in current tag to the last selected tag.
- Add ctrl+shift+super+tab binding to copy all clients in current tag to the last selected tag.
- Implement a layout that is exactly the same as tile with the difference that all masters are given their own area. The height of each master would be (m->h), the height of each non-master would be (m->h / (n - nm)) and the width of all clients would be (m->w / n).
- Implement a layout that is exactly the same as col with the difference that all non-masters are given their own area. This is basically the same thing as the tile variant but the nm is the amount of non-masters instead of masters.
- Add a rule for warping/not-warping cursor depending on client title.
- Apply nrowgrid and implement a variant ncolgrid.
