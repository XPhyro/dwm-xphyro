- There is a residual inner gap when gaps are toggled off, fix.
- If gappx is changed when it is 0, monitors are not updated, fix.
- On initiating moving or resizing with mouse, the client is reduced in size, fix.
- Resizing with mouse does not work, fix.
- Move gaps into Pertag.
- Make gaps toggleable per tag.
- Make initgappx per tag.
- Reverse smfact and cfact.
- Implement a layout like tile that uniformly distributes the clients in the two columns.
- Add shift+super+tab binding to move all clients in current tag to the last selected tag.
- Add ctrl+shift+super+tab binding to copy all clients in current tag to the last selected tag.
- Implement a layout that is exactly the same as tile with the difference that all masters are given their own area. The height of each master would be (m->h), the height of each non-master would be (m->h / (n - nm)) and the width of all clients would be (m->w / n).
- Implement a layout that is exactly the same as col with the difference that all non-masters are given their own area. This is basically the same thing as the tile variant but the nm is the amount of non-masters instead of masters.
- Add a rule for warping/not-warping cursor depending on client title.
- Apply nrowgrid and implement a variant ncolgrid.
- Make fakefullscreen per client.
